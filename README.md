# eBay Sales Data Processor

## Overview

This project is designed to extract, cleanse, and parse eBay sales data for accounting and analytics purposes. eBay transaction data, exported as CSV files, often contains fragmented details of individual transactions. This script consolidates these elements into a structured format, grouping by order ID and collapsing transaction details into a single row per order. This transformation facilitates better accounting and analysis of sales data.
